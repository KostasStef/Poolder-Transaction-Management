## Design
<p align="center">
  The design is based on a transactions wallet for crypto design. It can be found on:
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/nk1qMQdSuwWgXaic5lMqsa/Poolder-transaction-management-system?node-id=0-1&t=qq6qPS4K6QSLR6ba-1">Figma</a>

## Future considerations
<p align="center">
  With regards to a time constraint and the requirements of the assignment, the following features haven't been included:
  <ol>
    <li>Being able to select one or more transactions in the table(on transactions list)</li>
    <li>Being able to generate a graph to view the transactions per date(on dashboard)</li>
    <li>Being able to increase or decrease font size or icon size for people with bad eyesight(on settings)</li>
    <li>Being able to change email/password(on settings)</li>
  </ol>

  Currently, users will be prompted to sign up. Once that's done, they can navigate to the transactions list and interact with the app.
